This container derives from
[vcatechnology/ubuntu-firmware](https://hub.docker.com/r/vcatechnology/ubuntu-firmware) so that the
image has the latest [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) packages. It then
installs the some useful packages for building VCA firmware packages

Available on Docker Hub as [vcatechnology/ubuntu-firmware](https://hub.docker.com/r/vcatechnology/ubuntu-firmware/)
